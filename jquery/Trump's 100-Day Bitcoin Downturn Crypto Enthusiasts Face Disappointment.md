# Trump's 100-Day Bitcoin Downturn: Crypto Enthusiasts Face Disappointment

## Market Reaction to Trump's Policies

The cryptocurrency market experienced significant fluctuations following Donald Trump's return to the White House. Despite his self-proclamation as the "Crypto President," Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a 10.2% decline since its peak on January 19, 2025 - the day before Trump's inauguration. This downturn contradicts the high expectations from crypto supporters who anticipated substantial gains and increased legitimacy for the industry under Trump's leadership.

Alice Liu, Research Director at CoinMarketCap, observed, "Market enthusiasm reached its zenith on Trump's inauguration day but has been steadily declining ever since." Several factors contributed to this bearish sentiment:

- **Trade Policy Uncertainty**: Trump's aggressive trade strategies created market volatility
- **Meme Coin Controversy**: Investor discontent over Trump's launch of his own meme coin shortly before inauguration
- **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**: The administration's plan to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve primarily through confiscated assets rather than active purchases disappointed market participants

## Regulatory Shifts and Industry Impact

While the overall market reaction has been negative, Trump's administration has implemented several regulatory changes that crypto advocates appreciate. These reforms mark a departure from the perceived hostility of the Biden administration toward cryptocurrency regulation.

Key regulatory developments include:

1. **SEC Litigation Withdrawals**: The Securities and Exchange Commission withdrew lawsuits against major crypto companies like Coinbase and Ripple
2. **Bank Custody Guidelines**: The controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin No.121 was rescinded, removing liability requirements for firms storing crypto assets
3. **Crypto Task Force**: Executive Order 14099 established a dedicated working group to develop federal regulatory frameworks for digital assets

Eric Rose, Executive Director of Digital Assets at StoneX Digital, noted, "These policy changes are undoubtedly positive for the industry, but implementation will take time." He emphasized that banks requiring crypto custody capabilities need 12-24 months to develop appropriate strategies and infrastructure.

## Market Performance Analysis

Bitcoin's price movements since Trump's inauguration reveal significant volatility:

| Date          | BTC Price   | % Change From Peak |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Jan 19, 2025  | $109,225    | 0%                 |
| Feb 5, 2025   | $74,500     | -31.8%             |
| Apr 29, 2025  | $95,400     | -12.7%             |

While BTC recovered somewhat from its February lows, the persistent 12.7% decline from its pre-inauguration peak indicates ongoing market skepticism about Trump's crypto policies.

## Investor Expectations and Future Outlook

The crypto industry continues to push for more concrete policy measures that could drive mainstream adoption:

- **Clear Token Classification**: Definitive guidelines on which tokens qualify as securities
- **Stablecoin Legislation**: Regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers
- **ETF Expansion**: Approval for Ethereum (ETH) ETF staking capabilities and additional crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum

Market analysts emphasize that Trump's policies require time to manifest their full impact. The administration's approach represents a fundamental shift in regulatory philosophy, but practical implementation faces both technical and political challenges.

## Industry-Wide Challenges and Opportunities

While Trump's administration represents a regulatory pivot toward crypto-friendliness, several structural challenges persist:

- **Global Competition**: Other jurisdictions like Singapore and Switzerland continue developing crypto-friendly frameworks
