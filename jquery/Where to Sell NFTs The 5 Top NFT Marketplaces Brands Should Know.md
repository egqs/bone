# Where to Sell NFTs: The 5 Top NFT Marketplaces Brands Should Know  

The rise of **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** has revolutionized how brands engage with digital audiences. From Nikeâ€™s virtual sneakers to Gucciâ€™s digital collectibles, NFTs offer unique opportunities for revenue and brand loyalty. This guide explores the **best NFT marketplaces** for brands, focusing on platforms that balance accessibility, community, and profitability.  

## FAQ: What Are NFTs and Why Should Brands Care?  
**Q: What exactly is an NFT?**  
A: NFTs are unique digital assets verified on blockchain networks. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they are non-interchangeable, making them ideal for limited-edition digital goods like art, wearables, or music.  

**Q: Why are NFTs relevant for brands?**  
A: NFTs enable brands to monetize creativity, build immersive communities, and authenticate luxury products. They also open new revenue streams through royalties on secondary sales.  

## Understanding Key NFT Terminology  

Before diving into marketplaces, familiarize yourself with essential terms:  

| Term | Definition |  
|------|------------|  
| **Blockchain** | A decentralized ledger recording NFT transactions. |  
| **Gas Fees** | Transaction costs paid to validate NFT activity on the blockchain. |  
| **Digital Wallet** | A secure tool (e.g., MetaMask) for storing crypto and NFTs. |  
| **Royalties** | Automatic payments to creators when their NFTs are resold. |  
| **Ethereum** | The most popular blockchain for NFTs, though alternatives like Polygon exist. |  

## Why Use an Established NFT Marketplace?
