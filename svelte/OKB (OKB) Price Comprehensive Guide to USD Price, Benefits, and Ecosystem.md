## The Buy-Back & Burn Mechanism: Sustaining OKBâ€™s Value  

Launched on **May 4, 2019**, the Buy-Back & Burn program is a cornerstone of OKBâ€™s economic model. Hereâ€™s how it works:  

1. **Quarterly Repurchases**: OKX allocates 30% of its quarterly profits to buy back OKB tokens from the market.  
2. **Token Destruction**: The repurchased tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing the total supply.  
3. **Supply Dynamics**: Starting with a total supply of 300 million, the program has systematically decreased circulating OKB, creating scarcity and potential upward price pressure.  

This deflationary mechanism aligns with investor interests by ensuring that OKBâ€™s value isnâ€™t diluted over time.  

### Historical Impact of Buy-Backs  
| Year | Tokens Burned | % of Total Supply |  
|------|---------------|-------------------|  
| 2019 | 7.5 million   | 2.5%              |  
| 2020 | 8.2 million   | 2.7%              |  
| 2021 | 9.1 million   | 3.0%              |  

The consistent reduction in supply demonstrates OKXâ€™s commitment to maintaining OKBâ€™s long-term value.
