### Step-by-Step Redemption Process  

1. **Purchase Eligible Beverages**  
   Buy any two units of Le Faa Japanese Green Tea or Ceylon Black Tea (650ml) at participating Hi-Life stores.  

2. **Receive Exchange Code**  
   The **Bitcoin code** appears on your thermal receipt after payment. It includes a QR code linking to MaiCoin's redemption tutorial.  

3. **Redeem Through MaiCoin**  
   - Log in to your MaiCoin account (KYC Level 1 verification required)  
   - Navigate to "My Account > Redemption Code"  
   - Enter or scan the code and click "Redeem Now"  

*Note:* Redemption must be completed by **April 30, 2024**, and each customer may claim rewards only once.  

## Understanding Bitcoin Value Calculations  

The actual **Bitcoin** amount received depends on cryptocurrency market prices at redemption. For example:  
| BTC Price (NTD) | Reward Value (NTD) | Bitcoin Amount Received |  
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|  
| 2,000,000        | 30                 | 0.000015 BTC            |  
| 3,500,000        | 30                 | 0.0000086 BTC           |  
| 5,000,000        | 30                 | 0.000006 BTC            |  

Users must maintain minimum withdrawal thresholds (0.00002 BTC â‰¤ single transaction â‰¤ 0.7 BTC) when converting rewards to fiat currency.  

### Crypto City Editor's Field Test
