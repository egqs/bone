# What is OKB (OKB)? How to Obtain and Use It

## Understanding OKB: A Comprehensive Overview

OKB is a utility token built on the ERC-20 standard, powering the OKX cryptocurrency exchange. Introduced in 2018, this digital asset has gained significant traction within the crypto community due to its versatile applications and deep integration with the OKX ecosystem. As a utility token, OKB offers users exclusive benefits, rewards, and discounts across the platform, creating a mutually beneficial relationship between the exchange and its users.

### Key Features of OKB

1. **Transaction Fee Discounts**: Users holding OKB can enjoy reduced trading fees based on their token holdings and trading volume.
2. **VIP Membership Access**: OKB holders gain access to exclusive VIP tiers with enhanced features and personalized services.
3. **Token Sales Participation**: Eligible users can participate in early-stage token sales through OKX Jumpstart.
4. **Cross-Platform Utility**: Beyond OKX, OKB is integrated with various blockchain projects and platforms.

## How OKB Works

OKB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its security and scalability. As an ERC-20 token, it's compatible with most Ethereum wallets and decentralized applications (DApps). The token's value proposition is closely tied to its deflationary model and strategic burn mechanism.

### Tokenomics and Deflationary Mechanism

OKX implements a systematic approach to maintaining OKB's value:

1. **Quarterly Buybacks**: A portion of transaction fees is used to repurchase OKB from the market.
2. **Token Burns**: Repurchased tokens are permanently removed from circulation, reducing total supply.
3. **Transparent Audits**: Regular security audits ensure platform integrity and user trust.

This deflationary model creates scarcity over time, potentially increasing value for long-term holders.

## Factors Influencing OKB's Price

Several key elements impact OKB's market value:

1. **Platform Performance**: The success and reputation of OKX directly affect OKB's value.
2. **Token Burn Schedule**: Quarterly buybacks and burns reduce supply, potentially driving up demand.
3. **Market Conditions**: Broader crypto market trends and regulatory developments influence price movements.
4. **Utility Expansion**: New use cases and partnerships enhance the token's intrinsic value.

- **All-Time High (ATH)**: $73.83
