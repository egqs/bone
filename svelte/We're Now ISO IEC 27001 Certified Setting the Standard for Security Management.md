# We're Now ISO/IEC 27001 Certified: Setting the Standard for Security Management

## Introduction to ISO/IEC 27001 Certification

We're proud to announce our achievement of **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification**, the world's leading standard for information security management systems (ISMS). This globally recognized accreditation reaffirms our position as a leader in digital asset security, demonstrating that our security framework not only meets but exceeds rigorous international requirements for protecting customer information.

## What This Certification Means for Customers

ISO/IEC 27001 certification establishes a benchmark for information security management, requiring organizations to implement robust controls, policies, and procedures to safeguard data. For our users, this means:

- **Global Best Practices**: Your assets and information are protected under internationally recognized security protocols.
- **Third-Party Validation**: Security controls and governance have been independently verified by the **BSI Group**, a trusted certification body.
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Our systems align with international standards and industry benchmarks to address evolving cyber threats.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular audits ensure our security practices adapt to emerging risks and technological advancements.

## Our Certification Journey

Achieving ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification involved a rigorous 12-month process across our global operations. Key milestones included:

1. **Implementation of Security Controls**: Enhanced encryption protocols, access management systems, and threat detection mechanisms were deployed globally.
2. **Independent Audit**: The BSI Group conducted a comprehensive assessment of our ISMS, validating compliance with 114 controls across 14 domains.
3. **Leadership Recognition**: Gracie Lin, CEO of OKX Singapore, received the certification from BSI's ASEAN Managing Director, Emmanuel Herve, who praised our "forward-thinking approach to managing digital risks."
