## Critical Withdrawal Considerations  

### Blockchain Network Selection  
| Asset Type | Available Chains | Recommended Network |  
|------------|------------------|----------------------|  
| USDT       | TRC20, ERC20, OMNI | TRC20 (lowest fees) |  
| BTC        | BTC Network        | N/A                  |  
| ETH        | ERC20              | N/A                  |  

⚠️ Always match the recipient's network requirements to prevent fund loss  

### Transaction Fee Dynamics  
- **Standard Fees**: 0.0004-0.01 BTC equivalent per transaction  
- **Priority Options**: Higher fees accelerate blockchain confirmation times  
- **Network Congestion**: Fees fluctuate during high-volume periods  

### Special Token Requirements  
Certain cryptocurrencies require additional parameters:  
- **XRP/XMR**: Destination tag/MEMO mandatory  
- **EOS/STEEM**: Requires memo field entry  
- **NEO/GAS**: Tag verification critical

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|  
| Pending            | Transaction queued for processing          | Instant           |  
| Manual Verification| Required for high-value or suspicious transfers | 0-24 hours        |  
| Processing         | Blockchain transaction execution           | 10 mins-2 hours   |  
| Completed          | Funds confirmed on destination blockchain  | 1-6 confirmations |
