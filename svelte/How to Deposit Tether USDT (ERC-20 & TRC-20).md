# How to Deposit Tether USDT (ERC-20 & TRC-20)  

Cryptocurrency trading platforms continue to evolve, with Tether (USDT) maintaining its position as the most widely used stablecoin. This guide explains how to deposit Tether USDT via ERC-20 and TRC-20 networks on Axi, a leading trading platform. We'll explore the process, technical differences between blockchain networks, and essential considerations for secure transactions.  

## Understanding Tether USDT and Its Blockchain Networks  

Tether USDT is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, offering price stability in the volatile crypto market. With a market capitalization exceeding $83 billion, it dominates the stablecoin sector. Axi supports two primary blockchain protocols for USDT transactions:  

- **ERC-20 (Ethereum Network)**: Recognizable by addresses starting with '0x', this protocol offers robust security but typically higher transaction fees.  
- **TRC-20 (TRON Network)**: Identified by addresses beginning with 'T', this protocol provides faster transactions with lower fees.  

### Key Differences Between ERC-20 and TRC-20

| Transaction Speed     | 1-15 minutes      | 1-3 minutes   |  
| Average Fee           | $10-30 USD        | $0.01-0.1 USD |  
| Network Congestion    | High              | Low           |
