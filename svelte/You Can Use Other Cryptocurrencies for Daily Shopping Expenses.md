## Digital First: Instant Card Access  

Leveraging MasterCard's "Digital First" functionality, users can apply for and receive digital cards within minutes. Once approved, the virtual card is instantly added to mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, enabling both online and in-person transactions.  

This feature addresses a critical pain point for crypto users:  
- **Eliminates physical card delays**: Traditional debit/credit cards often require 5â€“10 business days for delivery.  
- **Enhances security**: Digital cards use tokenized transactions to protect sensitive financial data.

- **Biometric authentication**: Requires fingerprint or facial recognition for high-value transactions.
