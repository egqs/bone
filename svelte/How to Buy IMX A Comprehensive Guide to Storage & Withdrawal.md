You can download the Chrome extension for desktop users or access the mobile app via the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. This wallet serves as your gateway to interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) and managing digital assets like IMX.  

### Step 2: Create an Immutable X-Compatible Wallet  
Once installed, open Bitget Wallet and select **Create Wallet**. Navigate to the network list on the wallet homepage and choose the network supporting Immutable X. This action generates a dedicated IMX wallet, where all compatible tokens will be displayed.  

### Step 3: Purchase IMX via OTC Services  
Bitget Wallet integrates an **OTC (Over-The-Counter) service** for seamless crypto purchases. Hereâ€™s how to use it:  
1. Select your preferred fiat currency (e.g., USD).  
2. Choose IMX from the cryptocurrency dropdown menu.  
3. Enter transaction details and complete the payment using Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or other supported methods.  

After processing, your IMX balance will appear on the wallet homepage.

### Step 6: Trade IMX via Bitget Swap  
Once IMX is in your wallet, use **Bitget Swap** for instant trades. This feature allows you to exchange IMX for other tokens without intermediaries.  

### Step 7: Earn IMX Airdrops
