The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to act as a dynamic support level. This key moving average has been tested during previous pullbacks, providing a reliable bounce zone that reinforces the ongoing bullish structure. Analysts note that as long as Bitcoin maintains its position above the 50 EMA, the uptrend remains intact.  

### Next Target: $98,691  

ChartFreedom identified $98,691 as the next critical resistance level to watch. This price point aligns with previous highs and important Fibonacci expansion zones, making it a crucial area where traders may begin to take profits or reassess positions.  

Historical data shows that Fibonacci levels often act as psychological barriers, drawing increased trading activity. The convergence of technical resistance and Fibonacci analysis at $98,691 makes this level a high-probability target for the current rally.  

| Indicator         | Current Status       | Implication                |

## Key Indicators Flash Green: RSI, MACD And Volume Tell The Story  

Bitcoinâ€™s recent price surge is backed by a wave of strengthening technical indicators. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the neutral 50 level and is now hovering in the bullish zone, signaling growing buyer dominance outside overbought territory. This suggests thereâ€™s still room for upward movement without immediate risk of a reversal.  

Meanwhile, the MACD is displaying a clear bullish crossover, with the MACD line pulling ahead of the signal line. When the RSI and MACD indicators align like this, it often signals the potential for sustained price appreciation.  

### Volume Confirms the Breakout  

Supporting this momentum is a noticeable uptick in trading volume, which provides credibility to the breakout. High volume accompanying bullish price action usually confirms that institutional and retail traders alike are participating in the move. When price, momentum, and volume all point north, it paints a convincing picture that Bitcoinâ€™s rally may be far from over.

## Market Sentiment and Strategic Opportunities  

Market sentiment has shifted decisively in Bitcoinâ€™s favor. The combination of technical strength and macroeconomic factorsâ€”such as inflation hedging and institutional adoptionâ€”creates a fertile environment for further gains. Traders are advised to look for buying opportunities on dips, particularly near the $94,274 level, which now acts as a strong support zone.  

Even if Bitcoin experiences a minor retracement, maintaining a bullish stance remains valid as long as the price holds above the 50 EMA. This dynamic support level continues to guide the current rally, offering strategic entry points for risk-tolerant investors.
