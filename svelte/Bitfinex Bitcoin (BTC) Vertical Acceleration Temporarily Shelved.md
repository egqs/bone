# Bitfinex: Bitcoin (BTC) "Vertical Acceleration" Temporarily Shelved  

## Market Analysis: Bitcoin's Momentum Shifts  

According to Bitfinex analysts, recent declines in Bitcoin's spot trading volume suggest potential "local tops" in the cryptocurrency market. As buying pressure wanes and traders increasingly take profits, the three-month bullish run for Bitcoin may be losing steam.  

"Bitcoin's momentum is decaying for the first time during this uptrend," noted Bitfinex analysts in their Monday market report.  

Historical data shows Bitcoin (BTC) surged nearly 41% from its April 9 yearly low of $73,273 to $107,380 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap. This significant rally has positioned BTC as a key asset in the crypto market, attracting both institutional and retail investors.  

### Vertical Acceleration Pause  

Despite Bitcoin's substantial gains, analysts caution that order flow data and on-chain metrics indicate a potential consolidation phase or local top formation. "The market isn't experiencing sustained vertical acceleration," the report states.  

Key observations include:  
- Cooling spot trading volumes  
- Reduced aggressive buying pressure  
- Increased profit-taking activity, particularly among short-term holders who entered positions below $80,000

### ETF Inflows as Market Catalyst  

Market analysts emphasize that Bitcoin's next directional move hinges on macroeconomic factors and consistent institutional demand, particularly through exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.  

**ETF Performance Highlights**:  
| Metric                     | Value                  |  
|----------------------------|------------------------|  
| Consecutive Inflow Days    | 14 days (as of 6/27)   |  
| Total Net Inflows          | $46.3 billion          |  
| Weekly Inflow (Week Prior) | $22 billion            |  

Economist Timothy Peterson described recent ETF inflows as "tremendous," projecting continued positive momentum with a 70% probability of upward price pressure this week.

### Macroeconomic Influences  

The cryptocurrency market remains closely tied to traditional financial indicators. Bitcoin traders are currently monitoring the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision scheduled for July 30. Lower interest rates typically benefit crypto assets by improving risk appetite.  

Current market expectations (via CME FedWatch):  
- 19% probability of rate cut at the July meeting  
- 75% probability of positive market impact from sustained ETF inflows  

While short-term volatility remains possible, analysts maintain that the broader market structure remains robust. "The current data suggests a transitional phase rather than a fundamental reversal," the report concludes.  

## Long-Term Holder Dynamics  

Some market observers remain bullish despite recent corrections. Economist Donald Dean stated, "Bitcoin is preparing for an upward breakout through tight consolidation on volume platforms."  

Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards highlighted a critical factor limiting Bitcoin's price growth: persistent selling pressure from long-term holders. Since the January launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, these "whales" have systematically sold positions to institutional buyers.  

"Market participants wonder why Bitcoin lingers around $100,000 despite institutional FOMO," Edwards explained. "The answer lies in long-term holders actively offloading positions to Wall Street."  

### Market Outlook  

While Bitcoin's "vertical acceleration" phase appears temporarily paused, the confluence of ETF inflows, macroeconomic positioning, and on-chain metrics suggests a market in transition rather than decline. Analysts recommend monitoring key support levels and ETF flow data to gauge the next potential breakout.
