## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Bitcoin Trading Account  

### 1. **Registration Process**  
To begin, access the OKX platform via its official website or mobile app. The registration process involves two options:  

- **Email Registration**: Enter your email address, create a strong password, and complete the verification steps.  
- **Phone Number Registration**: Provide your mobile number and receive a one-time verification code.  

Upon submission, youâ€™ll need to complete a CAPTCHA test to confirm human identity, followed by email or SMS verification to activate your account.  

### 2. **Identity Verification (KYC)**  
While basic trading can commence immediately, advanced features like higher withdrawal limits require completing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. This involves uploading a government-issued ID (passport, driverâ€™s license) and a selfie holding the document.  

### 3. **Setting Up Account Security**  
OKX prioritizes user safety through multi-layered protections:  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable Google Authenticator for login and transaction confirmations.  
- **Password Management**: Use a unique, complex password and update it periodically.  
- **Device Authorization**: Monitor and restrict access from unrecognized devices.
