## üöÄ USELESS: The Meme Coin Embracing Irony  

USELESS has carved out a unique niche by directly confronting the criticism often leveled at meme coins: their perceived lack of utility. This meta approach has resonated with traders seeking satirical value in their investments.  

### Key Metrics:  
- Market Cap: $90 million (peaked at $100M)  
- Token Supply: 100% distributed to community  
- Holder Growth: 15% increase in unique wallets Q2 2025  

Unlike traditional meme coins featuring animal mascots (DOGE, SHIB), USELESS leverages minimalist branding through a plain golden coin symbol. The project's official channels openly mock typical crypto hype cycles, creating ironic appeal for crypto-savvy investors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PEPE: From Viral Sensation to Correction  

Once the fastest meme coin to reach $1B market cap, PEPE now faces significant headwinds. The token's price dropped 5% in 24 hours to **$0.000009499**, continuing its 35% retracement from April 2025 highs.  

### Technical Analysis Snapshot:  
| Parameter          | Value                     |  
|---------------------|---------------------------|  
| Resistance Level    | $0.00001013               |  
| Support Zone        | $0.00000946‚Äì$0.00000950   |  
| Daily Range (UTC)   | $0.00000940‚Äì$0.00001017   |  

Despite brief rallies like the 3.1% bounce triggered by a 91.9 trillion token volume spike on June 26, 2025, PEPE struggles to regain momentum. Market analysts attribute this to:  
1. Shifting capital toward Bitcoin (BTC dominance at 65%+)  
2. Reduced social media engagement (-40% tweets Q2 2025)  
3. Absence of new utility developments
